    <h1>About Flossie's Bakehouse</h1>
<p>Welcome to Flossie’s Bakehouse!

Flossie’s Bakehouse was born from a simple love of baking and a big passion for spreading joy through delicious treats. Every cake, cupcake, and sweet creation is handcrafted fresh each day with care, attention to detail, and a sprinkle of magic.

We believe that desserts are more than just food — they’re experiences that bring people together. Whether it’s a cozy birthday gathering, a milestone wedding, or just a treat to brighten someone’s day, our creations are made to make every moment special and memorable.

At Flossie’s Bakehouse, we combine classic flavors with creative flair, ensuring every bite is as delightful as it is beautiful. Our mission is simple: to make people smile, one dessert at a time.

Join us in celebrating life’s sweetest moments — because every occasion deserves a little sweetness.</p>
